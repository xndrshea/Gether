# Gether - Where Tokens Become Communites

Gether creates organic communities around tokens on the TON blockchain. Our vision is to create an open social platform that brings communities together, fostering meaningful interactions and collaborations around niche interests in the crypto space. 

Gether is building an open social platform using React, designed to bridge the gap between users and the blockchain. 

Each token has its own forum, prioritizing user interaction over speculation. This fosters active communities, regardless of trading activity, and provides a way to gauge organic token engagement, allowing users to see if people are actively communicating with other members of their given community.

## ðŸ›  Roadmap

We're excited to share our roadmap, outlining the key milestones that will shape the future of Gether.

- **Milestone 1: Launch MVP**

    We'll launch Gether.lol with basic features, including searching for TON jettons, viewing jetton information and posts, posting and commenting, and wallet connection and swapping. We'll also establish our online presence through Telegram, Discord, and a branded X/Twitter account.

- **Milestone 2: UI/UX Updates & Testing**
    
    Next, we'll enhance the user experience with features like like counts for posts, sorting algorithms, and a discover page for new and popular communities. We'll also refine our UI/UX based on user feedback.

- **Milestone 3: Community Creation & Trading**

    We'll introduce community creation, allowing users to launch their own jettons with bonding curves and co-create Telegram group chats. We'll also develop a Trading Terminal with dedicated trading pages for each community, charting, and trading functionality. Additionally, we'll collaborate with TON ecosystem builders and integrate more wallets.

- **Milestone 4: User Engagement & Monetization**
    
    To drive user engagement, we'll implement a points system, referral system, and create posts on the blockchain. We aim to reach 1000 monthly active users and generate cash flow through monetization. We'll also enhance user profiles with private and blockchain-based DMs and a subscribe feature for forums.
